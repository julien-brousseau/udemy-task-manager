# Task manager
A simple task manager built as the third project during the Udemy class [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) by Andrew Mead.
This application doesn't include a UI, and serves as a bridge between URL calls and a mongodb database.
